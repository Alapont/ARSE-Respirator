\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Target}
    Due to the actual health crisis (2020 march) and worrysome future projections, it is interesting to have an easy to manufacture ventilator, made with widely available elements, which will help breathing to sick people with the coronavirus COVID-19 without excessive external requirements.\\
    
    A plug should be enough to work, needless of pressure air or other requirements.
    Additionally, enriched oxygen could be added through the inlet port
    
\subsection{Requirements}
    The ventilator will be non invasive, preassurised air will be supplied through a face mask. Time and preassure of inspiration can be regulated. Exhale cycles will be passive, with positive pressure and adjustable in duration.\\
    
    Specifications have been followed from those published in the United Kingdom \cite{MHRA} as considered comprehensive and realistic, given the circumstances.\\
    
    This prototype is aimed to be inexpensive and built in a short period of time. Its functioning will be simple and easy to understand. Components will be readily abailable and cheap. These also will be non-toxic nor recycling cicles.\\
    
    All of these will also comply with requirements set by the Agencia Espa√±ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (Spanish Drug and Medical Products).
